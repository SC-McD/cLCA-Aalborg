## Day 1
### Including indirect land use changes in LCA

Many LCA practitioners are interested in including indirect land use changes (ILUC) in their LCA studies. This is because ILUC can be a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions for biofuels and bioenergy. However, there are many challenges to including ILUC in LCA. This is because ILUC is a complex system that is difficult to model. In addition, there are many different ways to model ILUC, and the results can vary significantly depending on the model used.
